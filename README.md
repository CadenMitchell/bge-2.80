# bge-2.80
All that remains of the Blender Game engine in Blender 2.8.

It appears that [youle31's](https://github.com/youle31) work on porting the Blender Game Engine to Blender 2.8 has ended. This is all that we have left of the project which I luckily salvaged from the depths of my hard drive. Everything should work as expected. I am no dev so you will likely see no progress on this repository. This is a very old build of Blender but anything newer crashes and anything really new has no icons and no game engine.

For now you can use the exact same instalation method that is recommended in the [UPBGE GitHub Project Wiki](https://github.com/UPBGE/blender/wiki). I've modified some install scripts to make it possible to compile (at least on Linux anyways.)

Have fun and happy Blending! ;)
